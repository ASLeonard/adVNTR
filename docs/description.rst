`adVNTR <https://github.com/mehrdadbakhtiari/adVNTR/>`_ is a tool for genotyping Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR)
from sequence data. It works with both NGS short reads (Illumina HiSeq) and SMRT reads (PacBio) and finds
diploid repeating counts for VNTRs and identifies possible mutations in the VNTR sequences.
